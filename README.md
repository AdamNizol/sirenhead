# Siren Head
### [Live Demo](https://adamnizol.github.io/sirenhead/)

Siren Head is a fictional horror character designed by the artist Trevor Henderson. In order to experiment with CSS keyframes for web animation I commissioned an artist to make a rendition of the character which I then animated in CSS and added mouse interactions with the character's mouths.
